# Week 4 - Predicting Employee Attrition using IBM HR Analytics Dataset

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is part of the NSP Nexus Internship - Week 4 task. The goal is to analyze employee data from the IBM HR Analytics dataset and predict employee attrition using various machine learning techniques. This helps organizations understand why employees leave and take proactive steps to reduce turnover.

## 📁 Dataset Used

**Dataset**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance  
**Source**: [Kaggle - IBM HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

This dataset includes various attributes such as age, job role, education, environment satisfaction, monthly income, job involvement, etc.
